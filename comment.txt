Thank you for your draft abstract.
According to your specification, we assume that you would like to do a advanced project.
You aim to fulfill all the requirements of the advanced protocol project suggestion 
provided on Canvas, and your basic Pong-game for the logic. In addition, you plan to
have a highscore system accessible via the advance protocol. Please make sure that have
atleast 3 highscore entries with 3-letter initials (that players enter if they reach the highscore)
as well as a menu for selecting to show the highscore table or play the game.
Also, please make sure to reach the basic Pong requirements (you can find them on the Canvas project homepage).
Good luck with the project!

# Advanced project: Pong

## Objective

This project involves designing and implementing a Pong game on a chipKIT-board. To reach the "advanced" project-level, we will keep track of highscores (games won) with non-volatile EEPROM memory as to keep scores saved when shut off. It will feature a 2-player mode alongside a 1-player mode against a CPU opponent with two difficulty modes.

## Requirements

- Game logic: Implement basic game logic to handle paddles and the ball.

- Player modes: Implement handling for multiplayer and versus CPU mode with multiple difficulties.

- Display interface: Implement rendering the game state alongside menu options for changing player modes, difficulty, and viewing highscores.

- High-score tracking: Implement tracking highscores (games won) and viewing them in a simple menu.

- Control interface: Implement controls using buttons and switches on the chipKIT.
